Emu:
- Mirroring of chip registers
-- create a "yoked" wrapper for multichip that responds to only lowest address?
- VRC6 exhibits "vibrato click" at A-3, see: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/239104268794200064/317404503986929664/test.nsf
-- clicking does happen on hardware but seems to be exacerbated by NSFPlay, maybe this is a sampling granularity thing?
-- Notice VRC6 has a 32-cycle delay after every sound register write in konami engines. Why?
- Option for what to do with long-PLAY lag. Wait for next interval, or run as much as possible?
- Non-returning-init timeout option to support quietust's battletoads RIP

- "APU clock" square should be 8 part not 16, and the divider should never reset manually, see: https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=185505#p185505 / https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=186129#p186129
- option to not disable bankswitch registers with bank 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
- full-emulation quality option (emulate at M2 speed and downsample)
- Rewrite 5B implementation for better synchronization with clock (is currently independent of clock).
- 5B does not support ImATrackMan's PWM envelope volume control (i.e. high freq square + env = half volume env)
- VRC7 emulation accuracy
- VRC patch update? evaluate this: https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=206193#p206193
- MMC5 squares, are they nonlinear, does PCM affect them?
- Battletoads track 10, noise sounds much duller on hardware.
- Triangle phase randomize init option.
- Better anti-click fadeoff?
- Play Metroid FDS 33 on hardware, make sure that wrapping is correct.
- Conversion of float to int, use _controlfp? or floor if offline precalc
- N163 bad-emulation options (old-length, no-phase write)
- Better post-processing controls: lowpass/highpass as specified cutoff, log slider, option for 2-pole etc., optional bandpass?, compressor, nonlinear distortion?
- look at clock_of_frame / clock_per_frame fixed point math, currently good enough for default 2MHz CPU but how well is it bounded with custom CPU speed? 10 bits would probably be sufficient, and go to 20MHz custom.
- mode for poll-style interrupts would be useful (to match poewrpak) vs NMI style (to match games/TNS)
-- wonder if battletoads noise thing is just CPU spikes?
-- (if frame length has exceeded, instead of break until next when it hits, run another frame and clear the counter)
-- test against BotB 20492 djmaximum - lights of are minds (virtuansf1061 recommended).nsf
- See thread: https://twitter.com/ImATrackMan/status/940851266191855616
-- Summary: Phase reset clicks are suffering from lack of timing precision, should be fixed when moving to a timing method that has cycle synchronization of writes and emulator.
-- Summary: 5B exhibits phase reset from $0FF to $100 but not $100 to $0FF transition?
UI:
- Play/pause/stop doesn't work like most player UI, revise their function.
- Command line wav could use fade out (actually set config param, also channel mask option).
- Command line wave have an option that temporarily sets a config value and restores it later (can use for fades, channel mask)
- Re-range volume sliders from 0 to 200%, default at centre.
- Play + no file loaded = open?
- Winamp plugin: hover over taskbar, play controls work but track select does not work properly.
- Winamp plugin: doesn't seem to save settings for a lot of people?
- Waveform visualizer
- Better errors in file validation (e.g. malformed NSF header, NSFe chunks, etc.)
Other:
- Play speed override option (keyboard adjustment should have more than just 1-8 integers), maybe allow CPU speed adjustment too?
- FDS write protect > default on if multi-chip
- suppress DMC pop if done in INIT (do one sample of output from mixer before play, then stick result in highpass DC filter)
- disable auto-skip on 1 track NSFs by default
- Infinite playtime option
- OPL2 notes, may help VRC7 implementation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18IGx18NQY_Q1PJVZ-bHywao9bhsDoAqoIn1rIm42nwo
- NSFLive memory access viewer: visual map of memory usage (like FCEUX code data log)
- DPCM ripper
- $4011 writes during init should pre-load the output without causing a pop at start?
- NSFe could use an N163 volume chunk. Maybe 64 = 8-channel full volume square = 2A03 level, or something? Should allow range that covers wider than existing usage, and produce a standard value that Famitracker could export, etc.


Later version:
- Seeking easier, seek when paused/stopped?
- Sound device selection.
- Bus/stack plugins: NSF validator, other export tools
- Improve loop detection
- APU debug pin emulation
- wider resample window? (i.e. multi-lobe sinc?)
- Mac/Linux versions?
- Foobar2000 plugin
- KB plugin
- NSF2
-- https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NSF2
-- register poll for "this is NSF2 compliant player"
-- IRQ timer
-- IRQ allowed (just uses current vector)
-- non returning INIT allowed, register to signal "ready" for sound to begin
-- metadata allow NSFe block of chunks to be appended to end
-- register location debate, was it in conflict with discovered test register?
- Visualizer plugin system. Full register view capability.
- De-MFC GUI, change to a .lib, and build directly into plugin.
- Remove plugin stubs from xgm, these belong in the plugin project itself.
- Consider adding a dendy mode to format? maybe save for NSF2?
- Breakout window for info (nice for looking at NSFe text chunk).
- One click button for keyboard view?
- Vertical stacking for multiple key dots on same pitch?
- Other: Infobox song position needs to be synched with true song position on open. (pass, this is a mess)
- Other: Behaviour with 2 NSFs in a playlist is counterintuitive.
- Always On Top > wxSTAY_ON_TOP on wxFrame?

NSFs:
- Sesame Street Countdown does not play. Bad rip?

NSF validation:
- VRC7 speed limit? (hard)
- illegal opcodes
- IRQ usage
- FDS vs other expansions
- writes to register mirrors
